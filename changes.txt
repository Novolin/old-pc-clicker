V0.1 - Initial/Proof-of-concept
- Display prototype: 16 colour support with DOS-style display feel
- Barebones menu system
- 80 x 35 characters of ASCII (unicode, really) goodness
- Number go up!

V0.2 - New Render Structure
- Changed rendering structure to be more logical
- Scrolling! Closable windows!
- Text entry, multi-line text entry!
- Customizable window size, but not font size yet.
- per-tick logic updated to be more easily passed to program state
- renamed some stuff to be more about thinking of this as a UI engine rather than a game engine
- hid your system mouse cursor, you don't need that while you're in here!!!

V0.2.1 - Some Small Additions:
- Added a text prompt window type
